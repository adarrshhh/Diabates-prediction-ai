# Diabates-prediction-ai
This work used four types of kernels, linear, polynomial, RBF, and sigmoid, to predict diabetes in the machine learning platform. The authors obtained diverse accuracies in different kernels, ranging between 0.69 and 0.82. The SVM technique with radial basis kernel function obtained the highest accuracy of 0.82.
